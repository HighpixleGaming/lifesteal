# Lifesteal
A vanilla datapack version of lifesteal!

-When you die you lose a permanant heart from your health bar, and when you kill a player you gain a permanant heart

-When you get to 0 hearts, you are put into spectator mode

-You can set to whether or not hearts drop as an item on death by running the command function ls:settings (the default is set to true)

-Respawn Beacons can be crafted to respawn players with 0 hearts left
